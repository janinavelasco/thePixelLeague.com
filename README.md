==================

I started this in Silex I don't know if that is actually what we want but It wasn't to bad just to set up a skeleton.

The Pages as in where the html would go would be in the templates/ directory. I made HomePage.twig you can look at http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/templates.html
to get a better idea of how to use the templates most of that stuff isn't nessecary to know for you guys. Basically just treat it like a
regular html file. 

I didn't make anything for CSS or JS but they would just be their own directories. I'm still thinking about a build system so there
is nothing like Pake or all that if you make a js file you need include them individually same with CSS. We don't have to end up using this
I was just bored so I thought I'd start us somewhere.
